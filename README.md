# SDAN-for-Rain-Removal
"Sequential Dual Attention Network for Rain Streak Removal in a Single Image"

In this GitHub pages, we provide our model demo for rain removal in a single image in conjunction with our research. We develop our program with adopted the code from: https://github.com/csdwren/PReNet. We test our model performance used 8 datasets from:

1. Rain100L: https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/struct/Projects/joint_rain_removal.html
2. Rain100H: https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/struct/Projects/joint_rain_removal.html
3. RainLight: https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/struct/Projects/joint_rain_removal.html
4. RainHeavy: https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/struct/Projects/joint_rain_removal.html
5. Rain12: http://yu-li.github.io/paper/li_cvpr16_rain.zip
